comments:	It is a small game I have written in approximately one day. Hope you have fun.
            Actually its a clone of a game I have seen some time ago (that was written in flash IIRC).

            You can replace the file in the data directory with you prefered pictures. You can modifie the 
            Levels too in the config file.
